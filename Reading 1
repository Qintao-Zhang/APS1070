Variable assignment: Here we create variable called spam_amount and assign it the value of 0 using = , whihc is called the assignment operator

Function calls: print is a python function that displays the value passed to it on the screen, We call functions by putting parenthese after their name, and putting
the inputs to the funciton in those parentheses.

Comment begin with the # symbol

The colon : at the end of the if line indeicates that a new code block is starting

int - short for integer
float - a number with a decimal place

a + b  addition 
a - b subtraction
a * b Multiplication
a / b True division
a // b floor division
a % b modulus
a ** b exponentiation
-a negation

5 / 2 = 2.5 float
6 / 2 = 3.0 float

5//2 = 2 int
6 // 2 = 3 int

Order of operations: PEMDAS - parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication / Division, Addition / Subtraction

Min and Max return the minimum and maximum of their arguments

abs returns the abolute value of an argument

int() and float() can convert their arguments to the corresponding type

#Functions
common pitfall: when you're looking up a funciton, remember to pass in the name of the function itself, and the result of calling that funciton

Defining functions
def least_difference(a,b,c):

create a function called least-difference, which take three arguments, a,b,c

Functions start with a header introduced by the def key work, the indented block of code following the : is run when the funciton is called

return is another keyword, it exits the funciton immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to calling context

Docstring:
""" Return the samlles tandlkgajsgjaslgjasdld

adsgjlkasdgjsadgjlk;asd

"""

No return statement return None in the end

Default arguments
print(1,2,3, sep = '<') 1<2<3
